1. Appearance: Daisies typically have a simple and charming appearance. They feature a round or disk-shaped center known as the "disk florets," which is yellow in color. Surrounding the center are numerous thin, elongated petals, usually white, though some varieties may have pink or yellow petals as well.

2. Growth and Habit: Daisies are herbaceous perennial plants, meaning they live for more than two years.

Daisies are commonly found in meadows, lawns, pastures, and grassy areas with well-drained soil and moderate sunlight.

5. Cultivation: Daisies are relatively easy to grow and can be cultivated from seeds or transplants. They prefer full sun or partial shade and well-drained soil. Regular watering and occasional fertilization can help promote healthy growth. Daisies can spread rapidly and may require periodic thinning to prevent overcrowding.

6. Medicinal and Culinary Uses: Daisies have been used in traditional herbal medicine for their potential healing properties. They were historically believed to possess anti-inflammatory and diuretic properties. However, it's important to note that their effectiveness and safety for medicinal use have not been extensively studied.
